                question: "Scenario 1: You arrive at the track for a big event, and the loud music and crowd noise feel immediately overwhelming, spiking your anxiety. What is the best sensory coping strategy?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Try to ignore the noise and force yourself to focus on your stretches.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Ignoring sensory overload is rarely effective; it drains energy. **Coping** means actively managing the stimulus." },
                    { text: "Find your coach and ask them to complain about the loud music.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "You can't control the environment. **Self-awareness** means focusing on internal adjustments." },
                    { text: "Immediately put on your noise-canceling headphones/earplugs and anchor your mind to your breathing routine.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This uses **sensory coping gear** (headphones) to quickly reduce the external stimulus and anchors your focus to a calming internal routine (breathing)." },
                    { text: "Pace around the track quickly to burn off the nervous energy caused by the noise.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Pacing reinforces the anxiety. The goal is to calm the nervous system through sensory control." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 2: You put on a brand new, stiff competition uniform, and the rough fabric is constantly itching, causing mental distraction 30 minutes before your event. What do you do?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Focus entirely on the race plan and try to mentally suppress the itching sensation.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Suppressing a tactile stimulus like itching is highly distracting. **Sensory awareness** accepts the input but actively solves the problem." },
                    { text: "Change back into an older, comfortable shirt, even if it's non-standard, and tell the coach why.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "The **comfort of gear** is vital for focus. Communicating the necessary change (Self-Advocacy) and prioritizing focus over a minor uniform rule (Coping) is the best choice." },
                    { text: "Ask a teammate for advice on how to stop the fabric from itching.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This takes up valuable pre-event time. If you know the item is faulty, replace it." },
                    { text: "Adjust the fabric repeatedly, trying to fix the sensation with every movement.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Constant adjustment makes the problem worse by creating a repetitive, distracting focus cue." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 3: The sun is low and blindingly bright, making you squint and throw off your sightline during a javelin approach. You don't have sunglasses. What's the best immediate adaptation?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Try to ignore the sun and hope it moves quickly.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Ignoring a visual stimulus that impacts technique is not smart. **Sensory coping** requires immediate action." },
                    { text: "Ask an official to temporarily stop the competition so the sun can set further.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "External demands are poor coping strategies. Control what you can: your visual field." },
                    { text: "Use your hand or the peak of your cap to aggressively shade your eyes and narrow your focus on the throw target.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This uses an accessible, **immediate physical coping strategy** to manage the bright light and forces your focus back to the target/process." },
                    { text: "Mentally curse the weather and complain about the timing of the event.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Complaining reinforces negative emotion and breaks focus." }

                question: "Scenario 4: You are running an easy recovery pace when you suddenly notice a lingering smell of strong chemicals (e.g., paint, cleaner) that starts to bother you. What should be your response?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Slow down and try to breathe shallowly through your mouth until the smell disappears.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Compromising breathing during a run is counterproductive. **Self-advocacy** means changing the environment." },
                    { text: "Find your coach and explain the sensory issue, requesting to immediately move your run to a different area of the track or grass.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is a **functional coping response**. You identify the negative stimulus and proactively adjust the environment to protect your focus and physical well-being." },
                    { text: "Speed up the run to get past the smell faster.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Rushing a recovery run breaks the physiological objective of the workout." },
                    { text: "Accept the smell as a necessary annoyance and try to distract yourself with music.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Active distraction often fails against strong sensory input. Address the problem directly." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 5: You perform well, and a teammate impulsively gives you a hard, loud high-five. The unexpected noise/contact makes you tense up. What is the best way to release that residual sensory tension?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Yell back excitedly to match their energy and release the tension.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Matching the energy reinforces the emotional spike. **Regulation** means returning to calm." },
                    { text: "Take one full, deliberate **exhale** while dropping your shoulders, then use a physical cue (like adjusting your watch) to reset.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This uses a **controlled exhale** and a **physical reset cue** to actively release the sudden tension caused by unexpected sensory input (touch/sound)." },
                    { text: "Mentally tell yourself to relax, but don't move or breathe differently.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Telling yourself to relax without a physical action is usually ineffective. **Regulation** requires a physical release." },
                    { text: "Avoid the teammate for the rest of the practice to prevent future contact.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This is an avoidance strategy, not a regulation skill. You need to learn how to recover from the unexpected." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 6: You are doing a visualization exercise before bed, but you keep noticing a recurring tactile irritation (a rough blanket, a stiff pillow). How do you handle this sensory distraction?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Continue the visualization and try to ignore the tactile sensation for the full 10 minutes.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Internal noise from sensory distractions compromises visualization. Address the problem first." },
                    { text: "Identify the irritation, adjust the blanket/pillow for immediate comfort, then immediately anchor back to the visualization cue.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **functional self-awareness**. You recognize the sensory interference and make a quick, autonomous adjustment to protect the quality of your mental task." },
                    { text: "Get angry at yourself for being so easily distracted.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Self-criticism fuels negative emotion. **Emotional regulation** means being kind and efficient." },
                    { text: "Switch on music to drown out the internal focus on the tactile feeling.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Adding more stimulus (music) might replace one distraction with another, rather than solving the root issue." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 7: During a high-intensity drill, the coach's whistle is extremely loud, causing you to flinch or jump every time. What is the best use of a planned sensory break?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Tell the coach you need to stop the drill immediately because the whistle is too loud.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Stopping the drill compromises the training objective. **Functional communication** should seek a pause, not an end." },
                    { text: "Ask the coach for a **planned, short break** after the next set, and use that pause to briefly put in earplugs.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This uses a **planned sensory break** to implement a **coping strategy** (earplugs) without disrupting the flow or intensity of the current set." },
                    { text: "Mentally prepare yourself to be jarred by the whistle every time it blows.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Mental preparation doesn't address the physiological flinch response. You need to dampen the sound." },
                    { text: "Just deal with it until the drill is over, then complain to a teammate.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Enduring frustration compromises the quality of your performance during the drill." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 8: You feel a sharp spike of anxiety when you see a specific competitor in the warm-up area. How do you use spatial awareness as a sensory coping strategy?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Stare intensely at the competitor to show them you are not intimidated.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Staring increases anxiety and shifts focus externally. **Sensory coping** needs internal focus." },
                    { text: "Walk to a quiet corner of the warm-up area, turn your back to the hub, and complete your routine facing a fence or wall.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is effective **spatial coping**. By manually restricting your visual field, you reduce the sensory trigger (seeing the competitor) and maintain control over your routine." },
                    { text: "Start your own loud, aggressive warm-up to intimidate them back.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Aggression wastes energy and is a failure of emotional control." },
                    { text: "Immediately go to the restroom and hide there until your event is called.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Hiding is passive avoidance. You need a controlled, proactive adjustment." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 9: You are throwing, and you notice your hands are excessively sweaty, changing your tactile feel on the implement. What is the best tactile coping strategy?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Try to ignore the sweat, as wiping your hands wastes time.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Ignoring tactile changes in the grip compromises safety and execution. Address the sensory input immediately." },
                    { text: "Take a three-count pause, wipe your hands thoroughly, apply chalk/powder if needed, and firmly regrip to reset the tactile feel.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is a **functional, tactile reset**. It uses a controlled pause and a physical action (wiping/chalking) to restore the desired sensory input (dry hands, firm grip) for optimal execution." },
                    { text: "Blame the humidity and throw with less force to avoid dropping the implement.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Reducing force compromises performance. The issue is tactile, not strength." },
                    { text: "Ask the official for a towel and spend several minutes drying your hands slowly.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Spending several minutes wastes valuable competition time. The reset must be quick and controlled." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 10: After a long, hot training session, your body aches. You feel a strong sensory need for a cold shower and immediate rest, but your schedule calls for a 30-minute structured cool-down. How do you regulate your impulse for immediate comfort?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Skip the cool-down completely and go straight home for comfort.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Quitting the cool-down is poor impulse control, sacrificing recovery for instant comfort. The structured cool-down is non-negotiable." },
                    { text: "Tell yourself: 'Recovery is part of the work.' Break the cool-down into three 10-minute segments, focusing on one small part at a time.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is effective **impulse regulation**. You counter the impulse for immediate comfort with an internal commitment to the *process* and use **chunking** to make the long task feel manageable." },
                    { text: "Try to rush the cool-down in 5 minutes so you can get home quickly.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Rushing sacrifices the quality and purpose of the cool-down." },
                    { text: "Ask the coach for permission to shorten the cool-down because you worked so hard.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This relies on external permission to abandon your routine, showing poor autonomy." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 11: You feel a wave of lightheadedness (a physiological sensory cue) during the middle of a hard interval. What is the most controlled, functional response?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Immediately stop the interval and sit down to wait for the lightheadedness to pass.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Stopping immediately is impulsive. You need to assess the seriousness first." },
                    { text: "Slow your pace, focus on a deep 4-count nasal inhale, and finish the rep at a lower intensity.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is the ideal **self-regulation** response. You adjust the intensity (flexibility) and use **controlled breathing** to address the physiological sensory cue, maintaining the integrity of the workout." },
                    { text: "Speed up to finish the rep faster before you pass out.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Rushing while lightheaded is dangerous and poor impulse control." },
                    { text: "Yell to a teammate that you need sugar immediately.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This creates panic and assumes a quick fix is available; focus on your breathing first." }

                    { text: "Don't worry about it, and just assume the rest of your preparation was enough.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Ignoring a key routine element is risky. You need a replacement anchor." },
                    { text: "Use the time to listen to any loud, fast song on your phone to get motivated.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Any loud song doesn't provide the familiar anchor. **Sensory anchors** must be specific and calming." },
                    { text: "Perform a 3-minute segment of your routine (like shoulder rolls) while silently humming the tune of your warm-up song in your head.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is a perfect **sensory substitution**. You replace the external auditory anchor with an internal version, linking it to a physical action to maintain the flow of your routine." },
